This is more of a "concept tool" than a full game, but you can play around with it here --> https://ikonico.itch.io/proc-sol-gen

You can also download this project and run it in your Unity version - I used 2020 LTS.

All of the coding bits are in the Assets/Scripts folder.

The goal of the project was to play around with procedural generation techniques. I focused on space (because why not) to generate solar systems and, more importantly, stories within them.
